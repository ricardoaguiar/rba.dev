I’m Ricardo. I grew up in Brazil, and at the age of 26, I moved to New York City, where I would live for the next 13 years and then 7 more years in Miami, before moving to Denmark with my wife. 
During my time in the USA, I’ve worked in food, advertising, and financing. Some were tech-related. While working in advertising in New York, I developed and tested HTML email campaigns and MVPs for Citibank, GE, and Pitney Bowes companies. 
To refresh my skills, I recently graduated from the seven-month intense Hack Your Future Bootcamp for full-stack web development in April 2020.
